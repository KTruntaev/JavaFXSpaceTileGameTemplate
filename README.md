# JavaFXSpaceTileGameTemplate
A simple game template to be used by students in a High School Intro to Computer Programming Class.

**Context:** I am a Peer Collaborator/Teacher's Assistant for an Intro to Computer Programming, and after seeing a need for a simpler way of leveraging graphics in the student's final projects, I have decided to create this simple template. This is primarily a supplemental template to the other JavaFX notes that were made for the students by me, which can be found on my Github as well.

**Goals:**
- Create a minimum viable product game, that is playable, yet open to easy improvements and changes.
- Create a simple, interactive showcase of various JavaFX elements, and how they are used in a sample game, in order to better teach the more complicated aspects of GUI development hands-on.
- Provide the premade graphical elements in order to remove the barrier of entry for students unfamiliar with JavaFX, and allow them to focus on the more game logic side. This allows for students to use what they learned throughout the course, from if statements to for-loops.

**Features:**
- A tilemap level system, allowing for easy modification of the level(s) by modyfying a 2D array.
- A simple swappable tile feature, allowing for quick changes to the game's tileset.
- A simple swappable animation frameset. 
- Examples of uses of random generation in order to make an "infinite" number of levels.
- QoL Features, including built-in on-screen level centering, one variable can change the size of all tiles, and another variable can change the size of the level, etc.

The students get 3 weeks to work on their final Intro to Computer Programming projects, usually a game. This semester was the first using my newly created JavaFX mini-cirriculum, and so far has resulted in great student feedback and greater enjoyment than any year before.
